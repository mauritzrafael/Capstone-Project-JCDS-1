# Spareparts-Controller-Application
This project is a Python-based application for managing spare parts stock, which was inspired by my past experiences while working in a factory.
1. Create: register incoming new spare parts to store.
2. Read: display all spare parts list. Spare parts can also be searched by inputting its ID or Name (most users are more familiar with spare parts' name).
3. Update: update spareparts amount, condition, and price.
4. Delete: delete spare parts in case of material aging or obsolete spare parts which in both case need to be scrapped.

Also there's an additional menu:
5. Transaction: allows intercompany purchases in case of other factory's emergency which needs ready spare parts ASAP.
