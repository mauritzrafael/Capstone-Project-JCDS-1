Capstone Project covering Python Fundamentals which was interpreted through Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Menus. I also tried to apply try except function here for error handling. 

This project is an application for managing spare parts stock, which was inspired by my past experiences while working in a factory.
1. Create: register incoming new spare parts to store.
2. Read: display all spare parts list. Spare parts can also be searched by inputting its ID or Name (most users are more familiar with spare parts' name).
3. Update: update spareparts amount, condition, and price.
4. Delete: delete spare parts in case of material aging or obsolete spare parts which in both case need to be scrapped.

Also there's an additional menu:
5. Transaction: allows intercompany purchases in case of other factory's emergency which needs ready spare parts ASAP.
